# Flight-Delay-Prediction-
Business Problem:
Flight delays cost the industry an estimated $25 billion every year. The bill for passengers an extra 25$ per hour and an extra 62$ per minute for carriers.

Objective:
The objective of the analysis is to Predict which flights would be delayed and by how long?

Project Flow:
1. Gained some domain knowledge to understand given attributes.
2. Performed EDA and created various visualizations using python and power bi.
3. Applied Data processing and Feature engineering techniques by giving more importance to necessary features. 
4. Studied the correlation between target variable with other features.
5. Built a machine learning model using decision tree classifier.
6. Used K-fold cross validation technique to analyze over-fitting issue and finalizing good parameters for parameter tuning.
7. Performed boosting techniques like Adaboost, Gradient boosting, catboost on algorithm.
8. Marked accuracy 92% on testing set in final model and noted feature importance for the same. 
9. Deployed model with single record and batch records prediction using flask as front-end framework. 
10. Deployed on Heroku by syncing with Github.
